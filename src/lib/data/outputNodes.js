		description:
			'Surface fire rate of spread is the "speed" at which the fire travels through the surface fuels. Surface fuels include the litter, grass, brush, and other dead and live vegetation within about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of the ground. \nThe SURFACE module allows the user to determine whether rate of spread calculations are done for heading fire, flanking fire, backing fire, or for specified directions from the ignition point or from the fire perimeter. The heading on the output pages specifies which spread direction option has been selected. \nThe surface fire rate of spread prediction uses the Rothermel (1972) surface fire spread model, which assumes the weather, topography and fuel are constant and uniform for the elapsed time. The basic model was developed for a head fire spreading upslope with the wind. Adaptations have been made to allow calculations for other direction options.'

		description:
			'Surface fire flame length of a spreading surface fire within the flaming front is measured from midway in the active flaming combustion zone to the average tip of the flames. According to Rothermel (1991), "Flame length is an elusive parameter that exists in the eye of the beholder. It is a poor quantity to use in a scientific or engineering sense, but it is so readily apparent to fireline personnel and so readily conveys a sense of fire intensity that it is worth featuring as a primary fire variable."\nBoth surface fireline intensity and surface fire flame length are related to the heat felt by a person standing next to the flames. Flame length is calculated from fireline intensity, which is a function of surface fire rate of spread and heat per unit area.'

Surface fireline intensity is directly related to and is used in the calculation of flame length.'

If the transition ratio is greater than or equal to 1, then the surface fireline intensity is sufficient for a transition to crown fire.

It is helpful to know whether the transition ratio is close to 1 or very different from 1. A value much higher than 1 may indicate that a transition to crown fire is more likely, while a value much less than 1 may indicate that the fire is more likely to remain a surface fire.
